# Adventures in COBOL

I recently found and purchased the "Advanced COBOL - 3rd Edition" book by Gary Brown at Half-Price Books out of curiosity for the language and it's history. This repository serves as a dumping ground for scripts that I scrape together as I try to learn about COBOL with examples outside of what the book teaches.
