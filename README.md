# Adventures in COBOL

I recently found and purchased the "Advanced COBOL - 3rd Edition" book by Gary Brown at Half-Price 
Books out of curiosity for the language and it's history. This repository serves as a dumping ground 
for scripts that I scrape together as I try to learn about COBOL with examples outside of what the 
book teaches.

One way that I'm going to help get use to just programming with COBOL is by going through Project
Euler problems. I acknowledge that a lot of solutions that I come up with will not be elegant, but
the reason is more to grow comfortable with the syntax - if I feel the need to hone my programming
style after learning the syntax then I'll likely go through past solutions to tidy up the code.
